FAST Diagram – Warehouse Management
About the Project

This project is an interactive web application built with GoJS to design and visualize a FAST (Function Analysis System Technique) diagram for warehouse management processes. The tool allows users to create, edit, and organize nodes representing different steps in warehouse operations, such as product reception, stock verification, storage, and optimization. With features like double-click editing, dynamic link insertion, and zoom-to-fit, the app provides an intuitive way to analyze workflows, identify dependencies, and optimize logistics.

Features

Editable Nodes: Double-click a node to rename it.

Add Nodes Dynamically: Insert a new node by double-clicking a link between two nodes.

Link Creation: Select two nodes and add a connection using the "Ajouter un lien" button.

Zoom-to-Fit: One-click zoom for a clear view of the entire diagram.

Customizable Title: Editable title for each diagram session.
